# Circular-buffer
I watched video on Youtube about animation in programming, and buffer was mentioned there, so I was inspired and wanted to try to do this kind of this data structure. During searching information about this structure, I found out that this structure is used in many areas of programming.
This data structure helps buffering different type of data streams. In my case integers were used for the data like the most common data type.

### Used technologies:
* C++

### Work on this project:
This structure wasn't hard for understanding, so the only problem that arose was the condition under which everything read and wrote correctly.






###### This code was written by Aliaksandr Karpovich, the student of Gdansk Technical University.
###### It's my first try to create this kind of data structure.
